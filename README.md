# Telegram-ChatBot
This project is an AI-powered Telegram chatbot built using Python and OpenAI’s GPT model. It uses Telegram’s Bot API as the interface to generate real-time intelligent responses, supports asynchronous message handling for scalability, and securely manages credentials via environment variables, with a lightweight Flask server for extensibility.
